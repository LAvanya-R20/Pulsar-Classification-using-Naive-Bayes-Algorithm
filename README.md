# Pulsar-Classification-using-Naive-Bayes-Algorithm
This project uses the Na√Øve Bayes algorithm to classify pulsar candidates based on statistical features from radio signal data. By training a model on the HTRU2 dataset, the algorithm predicts whether an object is a pulsar or non-pulsar with high accuracy.
